                Each patient receives a welcome call to introduce all the services 
                available to them, reassure them that, at this difficult time 
                of disease diagnosis and treatment initiation, they will get all 
                the help they need and ensure their needs are met.

                Subsequently, our care team will take care of any and all 
                details needed to ensure the patient quickly receives 
                their life-altering therapy: Ensuring all appropriate 
                documentation is in place, liaising with a specialty 
                pharmacy as needed, managing co-pay assistance programs 
                for eligible patients, liaising with insurance companies 
                for benefits investigation and verification, working with 
                physician offices and patients to manage any step edits 
                or prior authorizations, coordinating free drug programs, 
                providing any available financial assistance programs, etc.

                Our teams are trained to understand the underlying 
                reasons behind treatment discontinuations, and then 
                address those reasons with targeted interventions:
              </p>
              <p>
                From making routine adherence calls, to offering bridge drug 
                as needed, understanding adverse events, recommending 
                any available financial assistance programs, and 
                empowering patients to overcome any emotional or 
                other barriers to their treatment.

            <div class="content">
              <p>
                When a patient interacts with their case manager, the issue at hand 
                (e.g., dealing with all the paperwork and approvals needed to ensure 
                their insurance company quickly reimburses the drug prescribed by their doctor) 
                is often only half the battle.
              </p>
              <p>
                As part of that interaction, a wealth of real-world and nuanced data about 
                the patient and their disease is being exchanged: from details around doctor 
                visits, to their broader care environment, the day-to-day use of the drug, 
                adverse events, other related diseases, emotional and practical issues 
                regarding compliance and/or discontinuation, etc. Our advanced CRM and 
                AI systems allow our team to capture all those data points and insights, 
                combine them with broader data about each patient (e.g., claims, electronic 
                health records, etc.) and provide unique and actionable insights to the brand 
                teams as they plan their commercial deployment and execution.
              </p>
              <p>
                Of course, the privacy of patients is paramount. All data is anonymized, 
                and only summary statistics are available. Complying with legal and - 
                equally importantly - with ethical restrictions around the use of patient 
                data is core to our DNA and the way we operate.
